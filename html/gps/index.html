<h3> Release 4: Reflect</h3>
<p>The purpose of HTML 5 Semantic tags are they allow the coder to organize content in a format that displays structure and meaning. The ones I see as most useful are the header, nav, section, article, and footer. I think they are the most useful because content-wise its pretty standard to have all those elements in a website. The order of the browser is header, nav, section, article, and then footer (with aside to the right of section and article). I learned that Sublime allows you to create snippets that allow you populate tedious code with a shortcut. I definetely will use and create snippets for future use so my work can go a lot faster. I think the most challenging concept for me was creating my own snippet but I figured out what I was doing wrong. I think I will improve the more time I spend on creating and using snippets. </p>
