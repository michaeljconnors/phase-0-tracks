# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is where a programmer builds a different branch that enables the programmer to make changes to the work already done, without changing the master file. This is useful because a programmer can let another programmer make changes, and later decide if they would like to apply them later.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is an offshoot program based off the original file that can be updated and later merged to the master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit stores the most up to date content, on top of leaving a message for future users.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge confilct happens when disagreeing changes occur. When there is a merge conflict, the branch and the master cannot merge.
